A collection of type macros intended for making Cake pattern more
manageable.

The general idea of the type macros I want to implement here is
described in my blog post [Taming the Cake Pattern with Type
Macros](http://scabl.blogspot.com/2013/03/cbdi-2.html).

I'm just getting started here, as you can probably see.

TODO
  - api[A]
    - write a test for macro api[A] that returns A
    - write a macro api[A] that returns A
    - implement api[A]
    - with tests, user doc and scala doc
  - impl[A]
  -
